 <h4><strong>Why I Paint:</strong></h4>
<p>My passion in art grew from the weekly art classes in primary school even though we would mostly just copy sample images drawn on a blackboard by the Art Teacher.
 </p> 

<p>Discovering artworks of worldâ€™s greatest artists were true sources of inspiration insofar as I would examine their masterpieces meticulously and try to replicate their techniques into my own artwork.
</p> 


<h4><strong>How I Paint:</strong></h4>

<p>The painting process starts with basic drawing of subject with help of online <a href="http://www.griddrawingtool.com">Grid Drawing Tool.</a> I use this grid drawing tool to retain proportionate dimensions of reference images while enlarging them on canvas.</p> 
  
<p>I first block the major shapes, designs and forms of subject in acrylic while laying the layout of artwork after which I then paint in oil.</p> 


<h4><strong>What I Paint:</strong></h4>
              
<p>I paint landscapes, portraits, wildlife and anything else that catches my eye. Every new painting is a learning experience for me. I feel I have been blessed with a special gift and it is incredibly satisfying to know that I can spread some inspirations and joy around through my artworks.</p> 

    
<p>The medium of my artworks is primarily in oil although I use acrylic for blocking in of my artwork.

<p>The saying 'Practice makes perfect' is definitely true in art insofar as the great art masters have often stressed on 3 underlying words, <strong>"PRACTICE, PRACTICE,PRACTICE!!!"</strong>
